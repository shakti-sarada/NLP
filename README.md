# üåê Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## üìö What is NLP?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a fascinating field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It involves enabling machines to read, understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is valuable and meaningful.

NLP is the backbone of many modern applications such as chatbots, translation services, sentiment analysis, and more. By leveraging techniques from computational linguistics, machine learning, and deep learning, NLP enables machines to comprehend both the structure and meaning of text and speech.

## üß† What Does NLP Include?
NLP encompasses a wide range of tasks and techniques, including but not limited to:

### 1. **Text Preprocessing:**
   - Tokenization
   - Lemmatization & Stemming
   - Stop-word removal
   - Named Entity Recognition (NER)

### 2. **Text Analysis:**
   - Sentiment Analysis
   - Topic Modeling
   - Text Classification
   - Language Modeling

### 3. **Text Generation:**
   - Machine Translation
   - Text Summarization
   - Chatbot Development
   - Speech Recognition & Synthesis

### 4. **Deep Learning in NLP:**
   - Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)
   - Transformer Models (e.g., BERT, GPT)
   - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
